<em>
A deep understanding of concurrency is hard-wired into our
brains. We react to stimulation extremely quickly, in a part
of the brain called the amygdala, without this reaction system
we would die. Conscious thought is just too slow, by the time
the thought "hit the brakes" has formed itself, we have
already done it.

On a motorway, I mentally track the positions of dozens, or
hundreds of cars, this is done without conscious thought. If I
couldn't do this I would probably be dead.

If you have only one processor, your program can still be concurrent
but it cannot be parallel. On the other hand, a well-written concurrent
program might run efficiently in parallel on a multiprocessor.

Concurrency is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently.

Communication is the means to coordinate the independent executions.

    """Thread executing tasks from a given tasks queue"""
    def __init__(self, tasks):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.tasks = tasks
        self.daemon = True
        self.start()
    def run(self):

        while True:
            func, args, kargs = self.tasks.get()
            try:
                func(*args, **kargs)
            except Exception as exp:
                print_exc(exp)

        self.tasks = Queue(num_threads)

    def add_task(self, func, *args, **kargs):

        self.tasks.put((func, args, kargs))

    def wait(self):
        """Wait for completion of all the tasks in the queue"""
        self.tasks.join()
            </code></pre>

<h2>Threading model</h2>
<br />
<div align="left">
<p>What about shared resources, hah that's easy use locks, e.g.
<ul>
    <li>check resource</li>
    <li>"lock" the object</li>
    <li>do some machinery</li>
    <li>"unlock" the object</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Dealing with locks</h2>
<pre><code>lock = threading.Lock()

def get_first_part():
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        ... fetch data for first part from shared object
    finally:
        lock.release()
    return data

def get_second_part():
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        ... fetch data for second part from shared object
    finally:
        lock.release()
    return data
</code></pre>
<small align="left">
The standard lock object doesn’t care which thread is currently holding the
lock; if the lock is held, any thread that attempts to acquire the lock will
block, even if the same thread is already holding the lock. Details
<a
    href="http://effbot.org/zone/thread-synchronization.htm#problems-with-simple-locking">here</a>
</small>
</section>

<section>
<h2>And here it goes</h2>
<pre><code>def get_both_parts():
    first = get_first_part()
    second = get_second_part()
    return first, second
</code></pre>
<small align="left">
Are you sure it works? Some other thread modifies the resource between the
two calls, we may end up with inconsistent data
</small>
<pre><code>def get_both_parts():
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        first = get_first_part()
        second = get_second_part()
    finally:
        lock.release()
    return first, second
</code></pre>
<small align="left">
However, this won’t work; the individual access functions will get stuck,
because the outer function already holds the lock. To work around this,
you can add flags to the access functions that enables the outer function
to disable locking, but this is error-prone, and can quickly get out of hand.
Solution is to use

The problem with Apache is not related to the Apache code per
se but is due to the manner in which the underlying operating
system (Linux) implements concurrency. We believe that any
system implemented using operating system threads and
processes would exhibit similar performance. Erlang does not
make use of the underlying OS's threads and processes for
managing its own process pool and thus does not suffer from
these limitations.

<h2>Real world concurrency</h2>
<br />
<small align="left">
We don't have shared memory. I have my memory, you have yours,
we have two brains, one each, they are not joined together. To
change your memory I send you a message, I talk or wave my
arms. You listen, you see, your memory changes, but without
asking you a question or observing your response I do not know
that you have received my messages.
<br />
<br />

People function as independent entities that communicate by sending
messages.
<br />
<br />

If somebody dies other people will notice and do some actions.
<br />
<br />

These interaction patterns well-know to us, from birth onwards we learn
to interact with the world by observing it and by sending it messages
and observing the responses.
<br />
<br />

That's how Erlang programs work. This simple model of programming
is part of a model I call Concurrency Oriented Programming.

Erlang is a general-purpose concurrent, garbage-collected programming
language and runtime system. The sequential subset of Erlang is a
functional language, with strict evaluation, single assignment, and
dynamic typing. It was designed by Ericsson to support distributed,
fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications. It supports hot
swapping, so that code can be changed without stopping a system.
<br />
<br />

While threads require external library support in most languages,
Erlang provides language-level features for creating and managing
processes with the aim of simplifying concurrent programming. Though all
concurrency is explicit in Erlang, processes communicate using message
passing instead of shared variables, which removes the need for locks.
<br />
<br />

The first version was developed by Joe Armstrong in 1986. It was
originally a proprietary language within Ericsson, but was released
as open source in 1998.

<h2>Can we have both worlds</h2>

    <li>
Perl/Python/Ruby are dynamic languages, their strength is flexibility and
readability, it is easy to write program in them, but they luck of speed.

    <li>
Erlang is a functional dynamic language, its stregth is concurrency, but not

    <h2>Go, meet a new trend</h2>
<small align="left">
Go, otherwise known as Golang, is an open source, compiled, garbage-collected,
concurrent system programming language. It was first designed and developed at
Google Inc. beginning in September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>.
<br />
<br />

The language was officially announced in November 2009 and is now used in
Google's production systems. Go's "gc" compiler targets the Linux, Mac OS X,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, and Microsoft Windows operating systems and the i386,
amd64, and ARM processor architectures.
<br />
<br />
Go aims to provide the efficiency of a statically typed compiled language with
the ease of programming of a dynamic language. Other goals include:
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>
Safety: Type-safe and memory-safe.
</li>
<li>
Intuitive concurrency by providing "goroutines" and channels to communicate between them.
</li>
<li>
Efficient garbage collection "with low enough overhead and no significant latency".
</li>
<li>
High-speed compilation.

</ul>

    }
}

    c := make(chan string)  // create output channel
    go boring("boring!", c) // submit go routine, a la thread

<h3>Go goroutines and channels</h3>
<small align="left">
<ul>
    <li>goroutine is an independently executing function, launched by a go
    statement</li>
    <ul>
        <li>it has its own call stack, which grows and shrinks as required</li>
        <li>it's very cheap and it's not thread</li>
        <li>there might be only one thread in a program with thousands of
        goroutines</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <li>go channel provides a connection between goroutines, allowing
    them to communicate</li>
    <ul>
        <li>channel may have different data types</li>
        <li>you can mix and multiplex channels</li>
        <li>they're bi-directional</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.

            time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1e3)) * time.Millisecond)
